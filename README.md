# TensorFlow Exercises

TensorFlow is the most popular deep learning library as of now (2016).

This is designed to help those who want to familiarize themselves with TensorFlow functions. Particulary I took a strategy that I compare TensorFlow functions with the equivalents in NumPy, the de facto standard numerical computation library. I believe this is a way to help you be comfortable with TensorFlow quickly.

The basic outline will be as follows, though this is not 100% fixed.

* Constants, Sequences, and Random Values (DONE)
* Variables (WIP)
* Tensor Transformations (DONE)
* Math Part 1 (DONE)
* Math Part 2 (DONE)
* Math Part 3 (Soon)
* Strings (WIP)
* Control Flow (DONE)
* Images (WIP)
* Sparse Tensors (WIP)

To my knowledge, TensorFlow exercises are hard to find. Enjoy!
