Tensorflow Exercises for Beginners

Not surprisingly, there are non-trivial hurdles when you try to enter into the world of deep learning.
Tensorflow, the standard deep learning library for now, is one of them, if not the biggest.

This is designed to help those who are eager to exercise tensorflow functions. To my knowledge, Tensorflow exercises are hard to find. Instead of creating them myself, I borrowed the questions and solutions from Dr. Goodfellow's github, which is for theano practitioners. I simply converted each of the problem sets to the Tensorflow version.
